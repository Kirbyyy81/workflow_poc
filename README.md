## ‚ú® Features

*   **Visual Workflow Builder:** Create and connect nodes to represent project workflows using a drag-and-drop interface.
*   **Embed Live Figma Previews:** Embed Figma designs directly into workflow nodes for seamless design-to-development collaboration.
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Organize complex workflows with parent nodes representing the overall process and subnodes for individual components (UI, API, etc.).
*   **Node-to-Node Connections:** Visualize dependencies and relationships between different parts of your workflow.

## üß† Conceptual Model

The system uses a hierarchical model:

*   **Parent Node (Workflow):** Represents the entire process, like a "Customer Purchase Flow."
    ```json
    {
      "id": "workflow_001",
      "type": "parent_node",
      "title": "Customer Purchase Flow",
      "status": "In Review",
      "subnodes": ["node_ui_checkout", "node_api_payment"]
    }
    ```
*   **Subnodes (Components):** Represent individual parts of the workflow.

    *   **UI Node (Figma):**
        ```json
        {
          "id": "node_ui_checkout",
          "type": "ui_figma",
          "title": "Checkout Screen",
          "figmaEmbed": "https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=...",
          "status": "Approved"
        }
        ```
    *   **API Node:**
        ```json
        {
          "id": "node_api_payment",
          "type": "api",
          "title": "Payment Endpoint",
          "endpoint": "POST /api/payments",
          "status": "In Progress"
        }
        ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite
*   **Workflow Visualization:** [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## üöÄ Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/workflow-poc.git
    cd workflow-poc
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üîÆ Future Work

*   **Backend Integration:** Connect to a database to persist workflows.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement user roles and permissions.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Add features for multi-user editing.
*   **Notifications:** Alert users to status changes and updates.
